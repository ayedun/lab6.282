	abstract = {RNA polymerase II (Pol II) forms a complex with elongation factors to proceed to the elongation stage of the transcription process. In this work, we studied the elongation factor SPT5 and explored the protein–nucleic acid interactions for the isolated systems of KOW1 and KOW4 domains of SPT5 with DNA and RNA, respectively. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using three commonly used force fields that are CHARMM c36m, AMBER ff14sb, and ff19sb. Simulations showed strong protein–nucleic acid interactions and low electrostatic binding free energies for all force fields used. RNA was found to be highly dynamic with all force fields, while DNA had relatively more stable conformations with the AMBER force fields compared to that with CHARMM. Furthermore, we performed MD simulations of the complete elongation complex using CHARMM c36m and AMBER ff19sb force fields to compare the dynamics and interactions with the isolated systems. Similarly, strong KOW1 and DNA interactions were observed in the complete elongation complex simulations and DNA was further stabilized by a network of interactions involving SPT5–KOW1, SPT4, and rpb2 of Pol II. Overall, our study showed that the differences between CHARMM and AMBER force fields strongly affect the dynamics of the nucleic acids. CHARMM provides highly flexible DNA, while AMBER largely stabilizes the DNA structure. Although the presence of the entire interaction network stabilized the DNA and decreased the differences in the results from the two force fields, the discrepancies of the force fields for smaller systems may reflect their problems in generating accurate dynamics of nucleic acids.},

	abstract = {Spt5 is an elongation factor that associates with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during transcription and has important functions in promoter-proximal pausing and elongation processivity. Spt5 was also recognized for its roles in the transcription of expanded-repeat genes that are related to neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a set of Spt5-Pol II small molecule inhibitors (SPIs) were reported, which selectively inhibit mutant huntingtin gene transcription. Inhibition mechanisms as well as interaction sites of these SPIs with Pol II and Spt5 are not entirely known. In this study, we predicted the binding sites of three selected SPIs at the Pol II-Spt5 interface by docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Two molecules out of three demonstrated strong binding with Spt5 and Pol II, while the other molecule was more loosely bound and sampled multiple binding sites. Strongly bound SPIs indirectly affected RNA and DNA dynamics at the exit site as DNA became more flexible while RNA was stabilized by increased interactions with Spt5. Our results suggest that the transcription inhibition mechanism induced by SPIs can be related to Spt5-nucleic acid interactions, which were altered to some extent with strong binding of SPIs.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) have been closely studied during the past decade due to their importance in many biological processes. The disordered nature of this group of proteins makes it difficult to observe its full span of the conformational space using either experimental or computational studies. In this article, we explored the conformational space of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which is also an intrinsically disordered low complexity domain, using enhanced sampling methods. We provided a detailed conformational analysis of model systems of CTD with different lengths; first with the last 44 residues of the human CTD sequence and finally the CTD model with 2-heptapeptide repeating units. We then investigated the effects of phosphorylation on CTD conformations by performing simulations at different phosphorylated states. We obtained broad conformational spaces in nonphosphorylated CTD models, and phosphorylation has complex effects on the conformations of the CTD. These complex effects depend on the length of the CTD, spacing between the multiple phosphorylation sites, ion coordination, and interactions with the nearby residues.},
